# tokenized_warehouse_receipts

#### ***📦 Tokenized Warehouse Receipts on Solana***

#### ***🌐 Overview***

The tokenized_warehouse_receipts program is a Solana smart contract that brings commodities and futures trading onto the blockchain. It models a system where certified warehouses can issue tokenized receipts for physical goods, which can then be used in derivative contracts such as futures deals.

At a high level:

- 🏭 Warehouses certify and tokenize real-world assets as SPL tokens (receipts).

- 🏦 Markets define the trading environment, including fee structures and oracle authorities.

- 🤝 Deals represent futures contracts between a long and a short party, which can be settled either in cash or physically.

This program ensures transparent settlement, automated margin handling, and programmable trust around commodity-backed receipts.

⚠️ Note: This is a proof of concept developed using Solana Playground. The next version will be exported and maintained in VS Code for production readiness.
